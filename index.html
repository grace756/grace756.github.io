      <h2>About me </h2>
      <P> Hi am Grace, lately I have had time off work to look after my son who is nearly one</P>
      <p> I am a registered nurse and love caring for people, however,
        this job is not the most compatable with
        happy, balanced family life.
      </p>
      <p> I have decided to study with Dev Academy to become a software developer
        in the hopes that I will have a better
        work life balance</p>
