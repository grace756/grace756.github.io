        <h1>What is Lorem Ipsum?</h1>
        <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the
          industry's
          standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to
          make
          a
          type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting,
          remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets
          containing
          Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including
          versions
          of Lorem Ipsum.</p>

        <h1>Why do we use it?</h1>
        <p>It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when
          looking
          at
          its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as
          opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing
          packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem
          ipsum'
          will
          uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by
          accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).</p>


        <h1>Where does it come from?</h1>
        <p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical
          Latin
          literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at
          Hampden-Sydney
          College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage,
          and
          going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum
          comes
          from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by
          Cicero,
          written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The
          first
          line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.</p>
