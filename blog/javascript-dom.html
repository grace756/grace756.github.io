      <h2>JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS</h2>
      <div>
        <p>
          HTML(Hypertext Markup Language) creates the foundation for a webpage, it provides the structure for the pages.
          CSS (Cascading Style Sheet) allows developers and/or designers to style the content on a page such as colours
          and borders. The style sheet is linked to HTML so the changes will be displayed. Javascript provides
          functionality to a page, making it interactive. Javascript is a programming language that uses classes, ids
          etc to manipulate CSS and HTML to be dynamic, it takes care of animations and real-time updates, allowing for
          a responsive and engaging user experience.

      <h2>Control flow and loops, arrays, and objects</h2>
      <div>
        <p>
          Control flow determines the order in which statements are executed in a program, ensuring that the code runs
          in
          a structured and logical manner. Conditional statements like if, else if, and else allow the program to make
          decisions based on conditions, while switch statements efficiently compare a single variable against multiple
          values. Loops, such as for and while, automate repetitive tasks by executing code multiple times without the
          need for duplication.
          Arrays store multiple values within a single variable, making it easy to manage lists of data. Objects, on the
          other hand, organize information in key-value pairs, allowing for structured data representation. Together,
          these concepts help create efficient, flexible, and scalable programs

      <h2>Functions and whey they are useful</h2>
      <div>
        <p>
          In Javascript(JS) a function is represented as a unit of code that is invented to undertake a specific task. A
          function is then ‘called’ to begin working. In JS a function begins with the keyword function then a space and
          a
          `name` followed by parentheses(). The parentheses can be empty or contain parameters. The code that will be
          carried out is then placed inside curly brackets. Here is an example of the syntax for a function:
