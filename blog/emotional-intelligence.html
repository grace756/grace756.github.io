      <h2>What is emotional(EQ) intelliegence?</h2>
      <div>
        <p> Here is four things that define EQ</p>
        <p>
        <ul>
          <li>Self awareness- this means you can recognise your own emotions and actions and the effect they have on
            people who you interact with.</li>
          <br>
          <li>Self-control- is about to regulate your impulse feeling to better communicate your ideas or feelings</li>
          <br>
          <li>Empathy-being attuned to the emotions, feelings and needs of other people</li>
          <br>
          <li>Motivation-Letting your goals and objectives drive you. Be able to motivate those around you</li>
        </ul>

      <h2>How is EQ different to IQ?</h2>
      <div>
        <p>
          IQ (Intelligence quotient) is the measure of someone's intelligence. Emotional intelligence is knowing your
          feelings, limitations, strengths and how they affect you and the people around you
        </p>

      <h2>Why is EQ important</h2>
      <div>
        <p>
          People need emotional intelligence to be effective team members, or partners or parents. It's having
          governance over your own emotions and understanding the emotions of others. It means you can motivate yourself
          and others and give praise to yourself and those you interact with. Lastly it helps to regulate your inner
          critic, the voice that tells you you cannot achieve something. Therefore, it is greatly important to have EQ
          as it will make for a happier and more productive life.
