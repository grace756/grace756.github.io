      <h2>My problem solving process when blocked on a simple problem </h2>
      <div>
        <p>
          One time that I was blocked was when I was first starting to learn JavaScript (JS). I was meant to add a `!`
          at the end of a string. I missed this when reading the instructions so my code was returning an error.
          The problem-solving techniques I used were; First I googled and looked at sites such as Stack Overflow and w3
          schools but could not work out what I was doing wrong as my syntax looked correct. I then asked for help via
          discord and a facilitator discovered the missing exclamation mark
          The process was very frustrating, sometimes it can be so hard to see your own mistakes. I wrote, checked,
          deleted and rewrote my code so many times and in the end it was such a simple fix. Through this experience I
          learnt to examine my code character by character making sure I have written exactly what is required.

        <h2>How I elegantly solved a problem</h2>
        <p>
          How I elegantly solved a problem: the problem understanding operators and I felt that I learnt how to solve
          these problems quite quickly, they seemed more logical than some other JS methods. The problem-solving
          techniques that I used were; If my code did not work I checked my syntax then went over character by character
          as above. This process made me feel accomplished and like I was really starting to understand coding in
          general and I learnt that some aspects of JS are easy to pick up and it gave me hope that eventually all of it
          may feel easy and logical.

        <h2>My reflection on my confidence using the following problem solving techniques:</h2>

        <p>
          `Pseudocode`
          Using pseudocode is great when planning out a project. It helps to break it into smaller pieces and keeps your
          goals for the project at the forefront.




          `Trying something`
          I am becoming more and more confident with this. Previously I was worried about ‘breaking’ the code or getting
          lost when I changed things. Now I know that I can easily change things back to their original state if needed.
          So I try over and over until I succeed now




          `Rubber ducky method`
          Although I don’t actually put a rubber duck on the desk and talk to it. I do read instructions out loud to
          myself. I know that I am better at understanding what is required if I hear it instead of just reading. This
          modified Rubber Ducky method works very well for me




          `Reading error messages`
          Sometimes I copy and paste errors into google if I do not understand them but more often now I am able to read
          an error message and understand where I have gone wrong and modify my code as per the message.


          `Console.logging`
          Using the console log is a great way to test the code is working how it should, for example if, if the log
          returns undefined when it should return a number that is a good indication that the code is wrong.


          `Googling`
          Google is indispensable, I google so much when trying to solve a problem. It is an extremely helpful tool for
          a programmer



          `Asking my peers for help`
          Through my home group and the greater cohort I have been able to seek help from others via discord. I have
          privately messaged people when I know that they have completed something I am stuck on and even discussed
          problems via video chat through discord. It is very helpful to be able to reach out to peers.




          `Asking my coaches for help`
          I ask the facilitators for help through the ‘Help desk’ group on Discord. At first I found this too public and
          was embarrassed to ask what I deemed as silly questions but more often now I see that most of my questions
          also help the cohort as a whole so I am less hesitant to ask for help this way.




          `Improving my process with reflection`
          Reflecting is a tool that I am very familiar with as I was required to reflect frequently during my Nursing
          degree. I do see it as a helpful tool as it gives insight into how a person learns and helps them to see where
          they have struggled and how they have improved
