      <h2>Identity and values</h2>
      <div>


        Working as an RN I have plenty of ethical decisions to choose from but one that stands out is actually from when
        I was a student and on placement with a community based company. The team would get together once a week for
        lunch, just a general catch up. We would meet in busy cafes full of people. I became uncomfortable when some
        staff were discussing patients where they could clearly be overheard. They were also talking about things
        specific to those patients, identifying factors. I was concerned that someone would overhear and recognise the
        person being spoken about, hence a breach of privacy. I ended up speaking to my coordinator who in turn spoke to
        the team leader. Thinking back I believe I made the right decisions because I think it is wrong for a person to
        have their private lives discussed without their consent.


        I was brought up to be honest and kind, I was also brought up in a house where learning was fostered and was
        fun. This has shaped me into the person that I am. Someone who is compassionate, honest to a fault. I am also
        extremely curious and knowledge hungry, maybe that's why I have studied so many things!


        As above, a strength that will serve me well is my curiosity and my drive to learn. I will not like having
        problems I cannot solve and the will push me to keep searching for answers and learning


        I don’t yet see limitations to my learning because to me there is always more to learn. Career development is
        more tricky, I cannot yet visualise what role is right for me or which way my learning journey will take me.


        Aagin, here, I will bring up my training to be a nurse. Prior to my degree I did a certificate called Pre-Health
        and Science. In one of the classes I was placed in a group of 4 and tasked to complete a project. We were then
        asked to present our findings to the rest of our class. The classmates that I was grouped with did not do their
        portions of the work required and they didn’t come to team planning sessions. I ended up completing the work of
        4 on my own and presenting by myself also. At the time I spoke to my facilitators about the situation but was
        just told to do my best. I also spoke directly to the other members of my group, I probably let my frustration
        get the better of me when speaking with them which did not help the situation. Now with years of leadership
        practice, I know I would be about to handle a conflict like this in a much more productive way.
