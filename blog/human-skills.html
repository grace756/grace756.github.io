      <h2> Learning plan</h2>
      <div>
        <p>
          My long term goal is to work as a project manager or business analyst for a tech company as a independent
          contractor.
          <br></br>
          My limitations when it comes to learning are that I am dyslexic, this means that sometimes I need to read over
          instructions several times to understand and that learning new skills can take me longer than others. I also
          have a young child so time management can be difficult.
          <br></br>
          My strengths are that I am committed and determined. I started this course and I intend to finish it. Knowing
          when to ask for help is a further strength, I know that it is common for me to miss a part of the instructions
          given I need to be comfortable with seeking guidance.
          <br></br>
          I would like develop my problem solving and communication skills more while at studying at Dev Academy
          I will be respectful towards my pair's facilitators and any other persons aligned with this program. I will
          help my pairs if they need me too. I will work to fill my obligations in a timely fashion when working in a
          team environment.
          <br></br>
          If I am feeling pressure or frustration I will first have a break away from my screen, if I am stuck for
          longer than 30 minutes on a problem I will ask my facilitators, cohort or home team for help via the channels
          on Discord.
          <br></br>
          I expect that the facilitators:
        <ul>
          <li>will answer my questions as soon as they are able.</li>
          <li>That they will guide me to the right path if I am getting lost.</li>
          <li>That they will let me know if there is gaps in my learning or problems with my assignments that I need to
            fix</li>
        </ul>
        <br></br>
        My days are mostly scheduled around my son
        Tues-Friday he is at day care roughly from 8.30 -- 1245 including drop-off and pick-ups. This is my main study
        time. Other than that it is difficult to define when my timeframes as I will study when he is sleeping
        independently or he is with he dad.

      <h2>Idenity and values</h2>
      <div>


        Working as an RN I have plenty of ethical decisions to choose from but one that stands out is actually from when
        I was a student and on placement with a community based company. The team would get together once a week for
        lunch, just a general catch up. We would meet in busy cafes full of people. I became uncomfortable when some
        staff were discussing patients where they could clearly be overheard. They were also talking about things
        specific to those patients, identifying factors. I was concerned that someone would overhear and recognise the
        person being spoken about, hence a breach of privacy. I ended up speaking to my coordinator who in turn spoke to
        the team leader. Thinking back I believe I made the right decisions because I think it is wrong for a person to
        have their private lives discussed without their consent.


        I was brought up to be honest and kind, I was also brought up in a house where learning was fostered and was
        fun. This has shaped me into the person that I am. Someone who is compassionate, honest to a fault. I am also
        extremely curious and knowledge hungry, maybe that's why I have studied so many things!


        As above, a strength that will serve me well is my curiosity and my drive to learn. I will not like having
        problems I cannot solve and the will push me to keep searching for answers and learning


        I don’t yet see limitations to my learning because to me there is always more to learn. Career development is
        more tricky, I cannot yet visualise what role is right for me or which way my learning journey will take me.


        Aagin, here, I will bring up my training to be a nurse. Prior to my degree I did a certificate called Pre-Health
        and Science. In one of the classes I was placed in a group of 4 and tasked to complete a project. We were then
        asked to present our findings to the rest of our class. The classmates that I was grouped with did not do their
        portions of the work required and they didn’t come to team planning sessions. I ended up completing the work of
        4 on my own and presenting by myself also. At the time I spoke to my facilitators about the situation but was
        just told to do my best. I also spoke directly to the other members of my group, I probably let my frustration
        get the better of me when speaking with them which did not help the situation. Now with years of leadership
        practice, I know I would be about to handle a conflict like this in a much more productive way.
