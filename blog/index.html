        <P> Hi am Grace, lately I have had time off work to look after my son who is nearly one</P>
        <p> I am a registered nurse and love caring for people, however,
          this job is not the most compatable with
          happy, balanced family life.
        </p>
        <p> I have decided to study with Dev Academy to become a software developer
          in the hopes that I will have a better
          work life balance</p>

          <li>Write about the technical skills I have gained</li>
