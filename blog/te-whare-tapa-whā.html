      <h2>Te Whare Tapa Whā-Wellbing Plan</h2>
      <div>

        <p>
          Te Whare Tapa Whā is a Māori well-being model that has 4 dimensions-like the 4 walls of a house and the
          foundations the house sits on. The four walls are:

        </p>
        <p>
        <ol>
          <li>Taha tiana (physical wellbeing)</li>
          <li>Taha hinengaro (mental wellbeing)</li>
          <li>Taha wairua (spiritual wellbeing)</li>
          <li>Taha whānau (family wellbeing)</li>
        </ol>
        </p>

        <p>
          Whenua represents the land/roots of the house. The house and land is a metaphor for the holistic wellbeing of
          an individual. Here is my wellbeing plan that incorporates the values of Te Whare Tapa Whā:
        </p>
        <p>
          For my Taha Tiana I enjoy playing netball one morning per week and going for bike rides with my family. This
          therefore crosses over to the Whānau aspects of my wellbeing and is also great for my Taha Hinengaro as it
          makes me happy. I also try to stretch and rest my body when it is feeling sore. I plan to continue in these
          activities and would like to incorporate some more exercise also.
        </p>
        <p>
          My Hinengaro has already been mentioned above but I would further add that I practice, gratefulness and
          mindfulness throughout my day to centre myself, especially when stressed. I am prone to generalized anxiety
          and it helps me to talk things out with myself or right things down when I feel anxious. This helps me to gain
          perspective into what is driving this feeling and allows me to relax. I also understand that sometimes
          stressful situations can make me ‘snappy’ when I can have time to myself to understand why I am stressed. I am
          better able to move forward and control my emotions. My plan is to continue fostering my emotional and mental
          wellbeing.
        </p>
        <P>
          My Whānau is of great importance to me, it encompasses a lot of people in my life. My Whānua play a huge role
          in maintaining my mental health as they support me, my partner and my son. I talk to them and they give me
          guidance and wisdom. I am social and enjoy spending time with friends and family and see this as virtual for
          my overall health as well. I will continue to nurture the relationships that I have with my Whānua.

        </P>
        <P>
          I am not a religious person or particularly spiritual but I do believe in the universe giving what you need
          and the need to also give back to the universe. I believe in the power of positive thinking and of gratitude.
          For the benefit of my Taha Wairua I will continue to develop this way of thinking.

        </P>
        <P>
          Whenua for me is simple, there is a river in our backyard. When I want to remind myself how lucky I am to have
          the life that I do. I sit beside the river with no phone, no headphones and sometimes even no shoes. I listen
          to the sound of the river, look at the color of the trees, I watch the birds, I feel the warm stone on my feet
          and I feel grateful for my place in the world and for the life I get to live. I will persist in this practice
          and all others mentioned for the overall protection of my wellbeing.

        </P>
