      <h2>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the Human Skills learning</h2>
      <div>
        <p>
          One thing that I have learnt is that I struggle to just listen and I want to interrupt people when they are
          talking and comment on what they have said. Looping and listening helped me to realise this and I am working
          on my active listening skills.
          Another thing I learnt is mindfulness- to understand when I am stressed and to recenter myself or take a break
          when I am frustrated.
          Thirdly, revisiting the Te-wahare-tapa-wha module helped me to remember my roots and connect better with
          myself to benefit my holistic health.

      <h2>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h2>
      <p>
        Values help to guide decision making and to prioritise what is important. Empathy is an important tool when
        working with others, it helps programers understand their peers more fully and to help them if needed.
        self-awareness is a life-long pursuit. This helps you to master your feelings and emotions and achieve a
        work-life balance

        <h2> What has surprised you the most about the Human Skills learning</h2>
        <p>
          I did not realise previously how I connected with my roots and the land. Te-Whare-Tapa-Wha helped me to
          understand that I have a strong connection to nature and the clarity and sereness it provides.

            <h2> What were the most challenging aspects of the Human Skills learning?</h2>
            <div>
              <p>
                It is confronting to inspect the parts of my personality that I do not like or want to change. It was
                challenges to learn that I had some unsavory qualities

              <h2>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on Human Skills learning
                in a web development Bootcamp course?</h2>
              <div>
                <p>
                  Human skills are an important aspect of working in the 'real-world' after completing this program. It
                  teaches students how to interact with their peers, how to listen properly and how to work on
                  themselves
                </p>

                  <p>
                    It does not feel like a waste of time. The skills learnt in this course are fundamental for
                    successful career in the tech industry. One can easily learn programming languages but it is much
                    harder to learn how to be a functional human being that works well in a team
