      <h2>What is Neuroplasticity?</h2>
      <div>
        <p>
          Neuro-related to nerves and the nervous system.
          Plasticity- the quality of being easily shaped or moulded.
          Neuroplasticity-The brain and nerves ability to be moulded.

        <h2>How neuroplasticity is relevent to learning?</h2>
        <p>
          Earlier research into neuroplasticity focused on the growth and learning of growing brains i.e children and
          suggested that the brain's ability to adapt was most prominent during this time. Although, it is true that
          children learn at an unprecedented rate, it does not also translate that adults brains cannot be moulded
          through learning and repetition. In fact further studies suggest that the adult brain remains very pliable, as
          adult brains are capable of generating new nerve cells(neurons) , a process scientifically called
          neurogenesis.
          Learning cannot occur without changing the structure of the brain. Between neurons are synapses, this is where
          the nerve cells send messages and connect to one another. Learning and memory occur at these junctions as
          pathways are formed via new cell and synapse hence, neuroplasticity is hugely important for learning.

        <h2>What is a Growth mindset is and why is it important?</h2>
        <p>A growth mindset means that a person's beliefs and approach to learning are not fixed. They are willing to
          adapt and change their mode of learning to better understand. They further understand that ability and
          intelligence can be gained through effort. This is important because if they see learning as obtainable then
          that motivates them and they are more likely to succeed in their endeavors.
