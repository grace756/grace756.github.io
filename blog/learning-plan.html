      <h2> Here is my learning plan</h2>
      <div>
        <p>
          My long term goal is to work as a project manager or business analyst for a tech company as a independent
          contractor.
          <br></br>
          My limitations when it comes to learning are that I am dyslexic, this means that sometimes I need to read over
          instructions several times to understand and that learning new skills can take me longer than others. I also
          have a young child so time management can be difficult.
          <br></br>
          My strengths are that I am committed and determined. I started this course and I intend to finish it. Knowing
          when to ask for help is a further strength, I know that it is common for me to miss a part of the instructions
          given I need to be comfortable with seeking guidance.
          <br></br>
          I would like develop my problem solving and communication skills more while at studying at Dev Academy
          I will be respectful towards my pair's facilitators and any other persons aligned with this program. I will
          help my pairs if they need me too. I will work to fill my obligations in a timely fashion when working in a
          team environment.
          <br></br>
          If I am feeling pressure or frustration I will first have a break away from my screen, if I am stuck for
          longer than 30 minutes on a problem I will ask my facilitators, cohort or home team for help via the channels
          on Discord.
          <br></br>
          I expect that the facilitators:

          will answer my questions as soon as they are able.
          That they will guide me to the right path if I am getting lost.
          That they will let me know if there is gaps in my learning or problems with my assignments that I need to
          fix
          <br></br>
          My days are mostly scheduled around my son
          Tues-Friday he is at day care roughly from 8.30 -- 1245 including drop-off and pick-ups. This is my main study
          time. Other than that it is difficult to define when my timeframes as I will study when he is sleeping
          independently or he is with he dad.

        </p>

        <h2> Boot Camp Learning Plan</h2>
        <div>
          <P>
            What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?
            What are you hoping to use the skills you gain during this course for? What impact would you like to make
            once
            you leave Dev Academy? Do you have a destination in mind?
            Long term I hope to work in management in the tech industry and possibly be a business analyst. I want to
            understand the technical side of things first so I have a foundation of what is required when I am a manager
            or project leader. I am not sure yet where I would like to work, maybe something in healthcare though, to
            utilize my nursing background.
          </P>
          <br></br>
          <p>
            What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?
            My strengths will be interacting with my peers as I believe I am personable and work well in a team. I think
            my weakness so far might be javascript as I think I need much more practice with this.

          </p>
          <br></br>
          <p>
            Re-evaluate your strengths and limitations from Sprint 2. Has your idea of these changed throughout
            Foundations? Have you discovered any new ones during this course? How do you think these will help/hinder
            you during Bootcamp?
            In sprint 2 I was already familiar with CSS and HTML so I found strength there. The primer to Javascript was
            brand new and I found it difficult.

          </p>
          <br></br>
          <p>
            What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?
            Probably time restraints- especially if my son if home sick or something
            While you will face many technical challenges on Bootcamp, this is not what we would like you to consider in
            this plan. Non-technical challenges might include staying on top of the material, working in groups,
            speaking in front of the group, keeping focused for nine weeks, etc.
            Speaking in front of the group may also be daunting

          </p>
          <br></br>
          <p>
            What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
            I would like to improve my active listening skills and work further on my mindfulness
            At Dev Academy, we have a significant focus on human skills and improving yourself. Based on your
            strengths/limitations, what are some areas for development you would like to work on?
            For example, this could be communication, teamwork within groups, pairing with others, giving and receiving
            feedback, developing some leadership skills, or improving your self-awareness and reflective skills.
          </p>
          <br></br>
          <P>
            What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?
            I would like the team to be available for answering questions and general support
            What does support look like to you? Keep in mind, this may not be the same as the Bootcamp team's
            expectations, but it is helpful to voice these expectations.
            Letting us know when they are available on discord and setting up regular check-ins

          </P>
          <br></br>
          <p>
            What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp
            I want to manage my time well and learn as much as possible
          </p>
          <br></br>
          <p>
            Based on your knowledge of Bootcamp, how and where will you seek help in a timely way?
            I will ask for help via discord through the help desk or ask my cohort in general
          </p>
          <br></br>
          <p>
            Write down a commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.
            My son goes to daycare Tues-Friday 9am-3pm, I will use this time to do the majority of my bootcamp study.
          </p>
          This should include - an explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with
          other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives.
          I will be friendly and personable with my cohort and teachers. I will help when I can and ask for help when
          I am stuck
