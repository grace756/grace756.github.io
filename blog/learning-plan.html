      <h2> Here is my learning plan</h2>
      <div>
        <p>
          My long term goal is to work as a project manager or business analyst for a tech company as a independent
          contractor.
          <br></br>
          My limitations when it comes to learning are that I am dyslexic, this means that sometimes I need to read over
          instructions several times to understand and that learning new skills can take me longer than others. I also
          have a young child so time management can be difficult.
          <br></br>
          My strengths are that I am committed and determined. I started this course and I intend to finish it. Knowing
          when to ask for help is a further strength, I know that it is common for me to miss a part of the instructions
          given I need to be comfortable with seeking guidance.
          <br></br>
          I would like develop my problem solving and communication skills more while at studying at Dev Academy
          I will be respectful towards my pair's facilitators and any other persons aligned with this program. I will
          help my pairs if they need me too. I will work to fill my obligations in a timely fashion when working in a
          team environment.
          <br></br>
          If I am feeling pressure or frustration I will first have a break away from my screen, if I am stuck for
          longer than 30 minutes on a problem I will ask my facilitators, cohort or home team for help via the channels
          on Discord.
          <br></br>
          I expect that the facilitators:
        <ul>
          <li>will answer my questions as soon as they are able.</li>
          <li>That they will guide me to the right path if I am getting lost.</li>
          <li>That they will let me know if there is gaps in my learning or problems with my assignments that I need to
            fix</li>
        </ul>
        <br></br>
        My days are mostly scheduled around my son
        Tues-Friday he is at day care roughly from 8.30 -- 1245 including drop-off and pick-ups. This is my main study
        time. Other than that it is difficult to define when my timeframes as I will study when he is sleeping
        independently or he is with he dad.
